# Local Variables: A local variable name always starts with a lowercase letter(a-z) or underscore (_). These variables are local to the code construct in which they are declared. A local variable is only accessible within the block of its initialization. Local variables are not available outside the method. There is no need to initialize the local variables.

# Example:

age = 10
_Age = 20

puts age
